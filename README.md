> This is a colab notebook to support a blog post on
[Integrated Machine Learning & AI Blog](https://integratedmlai.com)

Our goal is to better understand principles of machine learning tools by exploring how to code them ourselves  without using the **AWESOME** python modules available for machine learning such as numpy, scipy, sklearn, etc.

We hope that these tools **will** provide insights and better understanding into machine learning and AI principles. If you've come here initially, we hope that you will explore the [blog](https://integratedmlai.com) and follow it's posts on using the other repositories.

I would appreciate it, as you share your work leveraged from this set of scripts, if you would please keep a referral back to my github repo. Thanks! I'd do the same for you. :-)

## Contributing

I am open to share the development and improvements of this with others, but it has been solo up until now. Let me know if you'd like to contribute.
